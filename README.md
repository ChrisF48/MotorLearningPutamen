Note that all the scripts require a specific folder setup using relative paths. These should be adapted using own requirements. 
The files are published for open access compliance reasons and are mostly undocumented with respect to their functionality. 
The scripts further rely on the availability of a normative dataset (human connectome project) in an appropriate structure as well as the individual
patient/subject data which are not provided due to reasons of data protection and copyright issues.
